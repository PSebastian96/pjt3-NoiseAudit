# Introduction

Welcome to my third project milestone's readme file!

NoiseAudit is a music oriented blogging site, where visitors of the site can join, create an account and publish blogs, reviews about: musical instruments, equipment and albums/artists.

This project is part of the third milestone project within the course from City of Bristol College in partnership with Code Institute.

The third milestone project's objective is to make a website that contains frontend and backend technologies with focus on the backend with python and flask framework. This enables to create a fully functional website, where users can join a website and interact with the content found on the website.

# User Experience (UX)
<a name="desing"></a>

### Design :

- Desing of the website is very minimalistic. The primary colours are black, green and white.
- The colour black is used to style the menu bar and footer.
- Body of the website is black/grey colour.
- The text is mostly green, which pairs with the black background colour.
- Menu links are green when hovered over as well as the footer links.
- For the Logo, I have used the 'Rubik Distressed' google font family.
- For the menu links, 'Henny Penny' google font family is used.
- For the titles, I have used the 'Gloria Hallelujah' google font.

### First time visitor goals :

As a first time visitor, I want to give basic information about the website, the purpose and what community this website is made for. In this case, this blogging website is about music lovers and musicians, where users can post reviews about artists, albums, music genre, music scene, criticism and musical instruments & equipment reviews.

### Frequent user goals :

1. Encourage the user to share and make reviews.

2. Let the users update their blogs. 

3. Connect the members and share with eachother their thoughts via comment section. 

4. Make possible removing and/or update their comments.

5. Encourage members of the community to visit the site frequently by reading, creating and updating 
   their blogs, comments and share new knowledge or music with eachother.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
