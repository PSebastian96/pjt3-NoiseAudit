# Introduction

Welcome to my third project milestone's readme file!

NoiseAudit is a music oriented blogging site, where visitors of the site can join, create an account and publish blogs, reviews about: musical instruments, equipment and albums/artists.

This project is part of the third milestone project within the course from City of Bristol College in partnership with Code Institute.

The third milestone project's objective is to make a website that contains frontend and backend technologies with focus on the backend with python and flask framework. This enables to create a fully functional website, where users can join a website and interact with the content found on the website.
